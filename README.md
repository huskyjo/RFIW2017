# Recognizing Families In the Wild (RFIW2017) Big Data Challenge
#### Data Challenge Workshop held in conjunction of ACM MM 2017.
-----------
**Overview**
This is the first large-scale kinship recognition data competition, in conjunction with ACM MM 2017, made possible with the release of the largest and most comprehensive image database for automatic kinship recognition, Families in the Wild (FIW).

FIW supports 2 laboratory style evaluation protocols:
1. Kinship Verification (one-to-one)
2. Family Classification (one-to-many)  
                       
To learn more, participate, and to download data we welcome all individuals and teams to register via CodaLab: Kinship Verification (https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/16745), Family Classification (https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/16742).
